title: "Pottery and Science: Finding Balance"

excerpt: "Reflections on how working with clay helps me think differently about my research."
---

As someone who spends most days thinking about cells, genes, and experiments, I've found that pottery provides a valuable counterbalance to my scientific work.

## Different Ways of Knowing

Science is precise, analytical, and often requires thinking in abstractions. Pottery, on the other hand, is tactile, intuitive, and immediate. There's something grounding about working with clay—it connects you to material reality in a way that pipetting and data analysis simply can't.

## Iteration and Experimentation

Interestingly, both pottery and research share a commitment to iteration. Just as I test different gene editing strategies in the lab, I experiment with glazes and firing techniques at the wheel. Failure is instructive in both domains.

## Making Space for Creativity

I've learned that creative pursuits outside of work don't distract from science—they enhance it. The mental space created by woodworking or throwing pots often leads to unexpected insights about my research.

Balance isn't about separating work and life; it's about integrating different modes of thinking and being.
