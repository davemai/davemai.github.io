I'm excited to launch this blog as a space to share my thoughts on science, research, and creativity. As a postdoc working on engineering human immune cells, I often encounter fascinating problems and insights that I'd like to share with a broader audience.

## What to Expect

In this blog, you'll find posts about:

- **Immunology and CAR-T cell research**: Updates on my work and exciting developments in the field
- **Synthetic biology**: Methods and approaches for designing new cellular behaviors
- **Craftsmanship**: My pottery and woodworking projects
- **Life in science**: Reflections on the research journey

## Why Blog?

Science communication is important to me. I believe sharing our work helps build connections, spark new ideas, and make complex topics more accessible. Plus, it's a great way to document my own learning journey.

Stay tuned for more posts!
